# nix-config

This is my [nix](https://nixos.org/) config for my development environment.

I use Nix on operating systems with outdated package repositories because it provides highly reproducible environments.

## Install

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for the installation.

```bash
just install
```
